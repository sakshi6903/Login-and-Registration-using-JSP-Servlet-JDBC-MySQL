# Login-and-Registration-using-JSP-Servlet-JDBC-MySQL
In this web development project, we will create a robust Login and Registration system that leverages the power of JSP (JavaServer Pages), Servlet, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and MySQL. This system will allow users to register for an account, securely store their information in the database, and subsequently log in to access secure areas of the website.
